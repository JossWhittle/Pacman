# Pseudo 3D Pacman Game
---

This project is an attempt to create a fully functional and featured Pacman clone which is rendered using a Pseudo 3D Ray-Casting method.

## Contributing

Those wishing to contribute to the project should 'fork' this repo and add their features on a (new) relevantly named branch. Issue me a 'pull-request' and I will merge to master.

## Contributing Textures
---

This is the biggest thing the project needs as currently the rather poor textures I have were cobbled together by me in a rush to have something I can render.

Textures are located in

	/src/src/resources/texture/

I encourage anyoned interested to take the theme in their own direction and be creative. 
I had the idea to use higher-res textures to make it look like a dark (and 'scary') dungeon with ghosts that subtly glow and are very transparent. I feel like running around in that with no indiction of where the ghosts are would make for a really fun and spooky twist on traditional Pacman.
